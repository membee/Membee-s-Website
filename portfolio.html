                    <h3>E-sports Experience</h3>
                    <p>After a year of playing and grinding, I got recruited to a E-sports team which my friend introduced me. The team name is 'The Devonair'.This was the first time I joined a tournament and it was intense at the same time, it was fun because of the competitiveness.
                        The following year, the team disbanded for several reasons, so I got to find myself another team, and it leads me to the team called 'Arkhon PH'. This team has many experience of being a team and joining tournamets, Arkhon was more advanced than my previous team, and it was hard in the first time but I manage to compliment my gameplay with them.
                        but I have to leave my team after months being with them because I have to focus on my studies. But this year I joined another team called 'Sonny Angels'. I joined this team because it is full of my friends and also I already miss playing tournaments.
